This is a full stack E-Commerce application using ReactJs to build the user interface of the application and NextJs as backend point such as file based routing, data fetching that allows server side rendering and static generation which makes my website incredibly optimised. I have also integrated the Stripe API which manages payments, products, shipping rates and entire checkout process. Also, used Sanity which is a unified content plateform through which we can change the home page of the store and details can be dynamically modified instantly.
